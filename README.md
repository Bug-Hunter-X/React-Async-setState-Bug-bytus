# React Async SetState Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React applications related to the asynchronous nature of `setState`.  The provided example showcases a counter component where the state update based on a previous state value fails to produce the expected result due to the asynchronous behavior of the state update. The solution section provides a way to solve this issue using functional updates.  This is a crucial concept for anyone working with React to understand and avoid these types of issues.
